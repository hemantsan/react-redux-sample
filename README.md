A basic react+redux sample app for learning the concept.

Redux is a standalone library and it can be used with any javascript framework or with pure javascript also. We can use it with react using react-redux package.

Installing Redux : `npm install redux --save`
Installing React-Redux : `npm install react-redux --save`

Redux works on actions, reducers and store. actions and reducers can be multiple in an app but there is only one store in every app which handles all input-output using actions and reducers.
